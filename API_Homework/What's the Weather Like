What's the Weather Like?

Used Python requests, APIs, and knowledge of JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?" Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator across temperature, latitude, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed. 

Used data from [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) and the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
